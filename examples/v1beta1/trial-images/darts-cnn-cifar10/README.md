# Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) Training Container

This is training container for the DARTS algorithm. It uses PyTorch convolutional neural
network and CIFAR-10 dataset to train the model.

To know more about using DARTS in Katib, check
[this guide](../../../../pkg/suggestion/v1beta1/nas/darts/).

Katib uses this image container in the [DARTS Experiments](../../nas/darts-gpu.yaml#L78-L89).

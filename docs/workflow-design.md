# How Katib v1beta1 tunes hyperparameters automatically in a Kubernetes native way

Follow the Kubeflow documentation guides:

- [Concepts](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/katib/overview/)
  in Katib, hyperparameter tuning, and neural architecture search.
- [Getting started with Katib](https://kubeflow.org/docs/components/katib/hyperparameter/).
- Detailed guide to
  [configuring and running a Katib `Experiment`](https://kubeflow.org/docs/components/katib/experiment/).

## Example and Illustration

After install Katib v1beta1, you can try the first Katib Experiment:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/katib/master/examples/v1beta1/hp-tuning/random.yaml
```

### Experiment

When you want to tune hyperparameters for your machine learning model before
training it further, you just need to create an `Experiment` CR. To
learn what fields are included in the `Experiment.spec`, follow
the detailed guide to
[configuring and running a Katib `Experiment`](https://kubeflow.org/docs/components/katib/experiment/).
Then you can get the new `Experiment` as below.
Katib concepts are introduced based on this example.

### Suggestion

Katib internally creates a `Suggestion` CR for each `Experiment` CR. The
`Suggestion` CR includes the hyperparameter algorithm name by `algorithmName`
field and how many sets of hyperparameter Katib asks to be generated by
`requests` field. The `Suggestion` also traces all already generated sets of
hyperparameter in `status.suggestions`. The `Suggestion` CR is used for internal
logic control and end user can even ignore it.

```yaml
$ kubectl get suggestion random -n kubeflow -o yaml

  ...
```

### Trial

For each set of hyperparameters, Katib internally generates a `Trial` CR
with the hyperparameters key-value pairs, `Worker Job` run specification with
parameters instantiated and some other fields like below. The `Trial` CR
is used for internal logic control and end user can even ignore it.

```yaml
$ kubectl get trial -n kubeflow

## What happens after an `Experiment` CR is created

When user creates an `Experiment` CR, Katib `Experiment` controller,
`Suggestion` controller and `Trial` controller is working together to achieve
hyperparameters tuning for user's Machine learning model. The Experiment
workflow looks as follows:

<center>
<img width="100%" alt="image" src="images/katib-workflow.png">
</center>

1. The `Experiment` CR is submitted to the Kubernetes API server. Katib
   `Experiment` mutating and validating webhook is called to set the default
   values for the `Experiment` CR and validate the CR separately.

1. The `Experiment` controller creates the `Suggestion` CR.

1. The `Suggestion` controller creates the algorithm deployment and service
   based on the new `Suggestion` CR.

1. When the `Suggestion` controller verifies that the algorithm service is
   ready, it calls the service to generate
   `spec.request - len(status.suggestions)` sets of hyperparameters and append
   them into `status.suggestions`.

1. The `Experiment` controller finds that `Suggestion` CR had been updated and
   generates each `Trial` for the each new hyperparameters set.

1. The `Trial` controller generates `Worker Job` based on the `runSpec`
   from the `Trial` CR with the new hyperparameters set.

1. The related job controller
   (Kubernetes batch Job, Kubeflow TFJob, Tekton Pipeline, etc.) generates
   Kubernetes Pods.

1. Katib Pod mutating webhook is called to inject the metrics collector sidecar
   container to the candidate Pods.

1. During the ML model container runs, the metrics collector container
   collects metrics from the injected pod and persists metrics to the Katib
   DB backend.

1. When the ML model training ends, the `Trial` controller updates status
   of the corresponding `Trial` CR.

1. When the `Trial` CR goes to end, the `Experiment` controller increases
   `request` field of the corresponding `Suggestion` CR if it is needed,
   then everything goes to `step 4` again.
   Of course, if the `Trial` CRs meet one of `end` condition
   (exceeds `maxTrialCount`, `maxFailedTrialCount` or `goal`),
   the `Experiment` controller takes everything done.
